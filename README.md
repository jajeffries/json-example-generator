# json-example-generator
I keep finding my self incorrectly hand rolling examples of JSON from JSON schemas, so I thought I would write something to do it for me.

## Status
It's not finished yet, but can do some of the basics. Enough to get started anyway. See the tests for what works so far and examples.

## Setup
`npm install`

## Tests
`npm test`
